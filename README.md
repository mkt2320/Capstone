# Virtual Mouse and Applications using OpenCV
As computer technology advances, the importance of human-computer interaction is becoming increasingly important. At the moment, touch screen technology in mobile devices is popular. But this technology isnâ€™t easily affordable and difficult in desktop systems. This is where Computer Vision comes into the picture. It could give an alternative by replacing the mouse and keyboard with a virtual engagement device that only requires the usage of a camera. This would work by using hand gesture recognition algorithms and methods to extract the various hand gestures. These gestures would be attributed to specific actions or movements of the mouse. The term "virtual mouse" encapsulates the essence of our project. Without using any hardware, the virtual mouse makes a virtual connection between the user and the machine. A Webcam will capture a person's fingertip, which will then be tracked by the system, which recognizes the hand's skin and movements and moves the cursor along with it. As an alternative to using a touch screen, we wanted to create a virtual mouse system that leverages a Web camera to interface with the device in a more user-friendly manner.
